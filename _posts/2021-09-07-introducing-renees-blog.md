title: writing and I - an attempt to fix a toxic relationship
---

Writing and I met when I was still a young lad. We were forcibly fixed up by my school teachers. It was not quite love at first sight, or second sight. In fact, we had a thing that's kept in the dark; I never knew if the world of words is ever particularly fond of me and I never knew if I enjoying writing them. Moreover, my writing was someone I felt extremely possessive and secretive about. Any peek was a invasion of privacy and any comment was a storm too destructive.

Over the past couple of years, I got my treasured writings criticized and plagiarized. Eventually, writing and I parted ways, as I go on to join the STEM force. But these days, I begin to ponder. Despite all the heartaches and headaches, I miss it. And I need it.

So here I am, attempting to fix this toxic relationship.
