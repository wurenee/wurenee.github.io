title: Oct 17th - 24th weekly digest 01

Weekly Digest is something I wanted to do for a long time, inspired by other bloggers. Just a simple and plain record of what I have read, watched, listened to or thought about. To forcibly assert meanings onto mundane life.

* Essen Spiel
Essen Spiel is one of the world's largest board game expo. I somehow had the conviction to drag myself onto the train for a nine hours round-trip commute. Fortunately, the long hours are perfectly justified by the amount of fun at Spiel. Despite the pandamics, there were thousands of visitors and tableful of games.



* Q-summit Hackathon presize.ai challenge
This week I attended my first ever hackathon at Q-summit. I was extremely lucky to have a nice mix of technical minded and business minded teammates. 

* Tiny Beautiful Things
