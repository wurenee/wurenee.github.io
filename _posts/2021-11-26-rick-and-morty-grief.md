title: Nov 27th - Rick and Morty, a story about grief
---


** Below contains spoilers for Wandavision and Rick and Morty Season 5 **

Wandavision is a story about Wanda, after losing the love of her life, created a false reality as a cope mechanism with grief. Grief can be such an intense emotion that the gravity of its pain makes escapism a way better alternative. But eventually, as all illusions do, the sit-com universe Wanda created has to shatter so her life may go on. This is the only way us human can deal with grief; to face it head-on and let us be defeated, so that time will one day smooth out the pain.

You might wonder, how does that have anything to do with Rick and Morty, a show about an intergalactic asshole and his grandson. Well, it mostly doesn't. But after the finale of season 5, with the revelation of central finite curve and "evil" Morty's ultimate plan, it becomes clear that Rick and Morty (canon storyline) is one about grief.

After losing his original Diana and Beth, C-137 Rick becomes obsessed with avenging his dead wife and daughter. He created the central finite curve to limit infinite parallel universes to only the ones where Rick is the smartest person in the universe, assuming that the Rick who killed his wife would be in these universes. Eventually, C-137 Rick could not avenge the right killer and decided to drown himself in alcoholism. This is how the series begins. After the loss of his wife, the protagonist created a false reality (central finite curve is not entirely false as those universes are real. But it only offers limited range of reality. I'd argue that a narrowed reality is a skewed one. Not to mention how toxic the citadel is.) and drowns himself in escapism from coping with his loss.

The season finale does not only put the series in the context of grievance, but also shows promises of Rick moving on. In Wandavision, it was the evil witch Agatha and the effort of FBI (and others?) that force a pain-ridden Wanda to face the gravity of her situation and made her leave the cinematic world she created with her mind. "Evil" Morty, in my opinion, serves a similar purpose. As he flies through a vagina-shaped wormhole, he confronts a new reality, the more general the more enduring reality of infinite possibilities (where the portals are yellow!!). Eventually, C-137 has to come out to face the reality and finally find peace and solace. Because it is the only way us human can defeat grief.
